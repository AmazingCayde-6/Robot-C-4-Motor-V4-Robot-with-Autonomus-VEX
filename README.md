# Robot-C-4-Motor-V4-Robot-with-Autonomus-VEX
Hi, welcome to my 1st attempt of the VEX ecosystem. this is for me to learn to use C and other codeing languages. I started this code in
January of 2020. in that time there have been MANY changes in the code. this is the ones that have A. worked for me, or B. ones that i am
using in the future. feel free to contribute to the code thus idk what i am doing to much. with this code we have successfully made it to 
the 3rd bracket to go to the state compotition on Jan 18 2020. as far as i need is to figure out why the autonomus mode is not preforming 
with the code that is written... sometmes it dose exactly what it was programed to do, sometimes it goes all over the place and only dose 
part f what it is suppost to do. i am planning on posting all the revisions here as well on the GIT.
